 Hello!

 My name is Ben Lepsch. I graduated as a Rodman Scholar from the University of Virginia Engineering School in 2024 with a degree in Computer Science, and I'm looking for a job in software / app development. In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing, backpacking, playing guitar and banjo, reading, and working on old cars.
 
 
 Feel free to contact me at `blepsch@gmail.com` or on Discord `@blepsh` -- I'm always open to chat about programming, rock climbing, 90s Japanese trucks, backpacking, minecraft, bluegrass guitar, books, you name it
